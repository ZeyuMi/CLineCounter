CLineCounter
============

CLineCounter is a simple program for counting the number of code lines of a C program.

Counter just takes file ended with '.c' or '.h' into consideration, and all the other files are ignored.

Counter takes the absolute path of only one file or directory from command line as input.

Note: Because I use the Unix system call to manipulate directory and file, please run this program in Unix environment.
